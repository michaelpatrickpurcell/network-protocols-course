\begin{frame}[triangle=siiblue]
	\frametitle{Secure Communications Channel}
	Alice and Bob want to use an asymmetric encryption scheme establish a secure communications channel.
	
	\vfill
	
	Accordingly, both parties generate public/private key pairs and share the public keys with one another.
		
	\vfill
	
	To send a message, the sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt their transmission. The recipient then uses the corresponding private key to decrypt the transmission that they receive.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[triangle=siiblue]
	\frametitle{An Active Adversary}
	Eve wants to eavesdrop on the conversation between Alice and Bob.
	Wee assume that Eve is an active adversary. That is, we assume that Eve can:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item intercept messages sent from Alice to Bob and vice versa.
		\item send messages to Alice or Bob. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vfill
	
	If Eve can intercept the messages that Alice and Bob use to share their public keys with one another, then she can carry out a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[triangle=siiblue]
	\frametitle{Man-in-the-Middle Attack}
	When Eve intercepts a key-exchange messages, she replaces the message with on containing a public key for which she knows the corresponding private key.
	
	\vfill
	
	When Eve intercepts an encrypted message, she:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item decrypts the message using her private key.
		\item inspects and/or modifies the message.
		\item encrypts the message using the recipient's public key.
		\item sends the encrypted message to the recipient.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Public Key Certificates}
\begin{frame}[Triangle=siiorange]
	\tocpage
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[triangle=siiblue]
	\frametitle{Structure}
	A public key certificate is an electronic document which is used to prove ownership of a public key.  	Each certificate contains information about:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the subject's identity.
		\item the subject's public key.
		\item the issuer's identity.
		\item the issuer's digital signature.
	\end{itemize}

	\vfill

	The issuer signs the certificate using the private key associated with a public key that they own.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[triangle=siiblue]
	\frametitle{Certificate Chains}
	By signing a public key certificate, the issuer is claiming that the subject is the rightful owner of the public key.
	
	\vfill
	
	The issuer's public key is used to verify their signature.  
	
	\vfill
	
	Therefore, the issuer must themselves provide a public key certificate that proves that they are the rightful owner of the public key required to verify their signature.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[triangle=siiblue]
	\frametitle{Root Certificate Authorities}
	Certificate chains terminate when they reach a certificate that has been signed by a user whose ownership of a public key has been previously established.
	
	\vfill
	
	In most certificate ecosystems, certificate chains terminate when they reach a root certificate. Root certificates are self-signed certificates that are trusted by default.
	
	\vfill
	
	Root certificates identify root certificate authorities which are generally vetted through some mechanism external to the certificate ecosystem.
